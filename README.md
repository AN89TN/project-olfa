#Project OneListForAll

This project aim to create my first app in react backed with an express server.

The app is intended to use as a simple list app that can handle different behaviors.

For this app was used the MERN stack, MongoDB with Mongoose as a database where i learned how to query in multiple nested arrays and server side data preparation, Express and Node with multiple packages for handling the routes of the backend and the secure connections, React as a frontend with Axios for the connections and Redux for the secure login with JWT and csrf protection using refresh token validation from backend.

From this project i learned the react hooks and a bit more how to handle JS, in the end the worst part was to discover the data i prepared was too nested for a good DB handling and i was forced to change it a bit.

For a Look of what it is when deployed: https://onelistforall.herokuapp.com/.
